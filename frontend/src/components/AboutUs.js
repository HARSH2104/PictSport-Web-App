          Welcome to our Student Marketplace! We provide a platform for students
          to sell their used books and calculators, making it easy to connect
          buyers and sellers within the student community.
          <br></br> Our mission is to create a sustainable and affordable
          solution for students who want to sell their old study materials and
          for those who are looking for discounted options. We believe that by
          reusing and recycling resources, we can contribute to a greener and
          more environmentally-friendly world.
